My name is Rockie, Rockie Yang<br><br>

The presentation has two parts. 
The first part is about crawling data from Jenkins Server.
It's a bit boring. But it's an essential step for data analysis<br><br>

Then we can have a short break<br>

The second part is about data analysis on Apache Zeppelin.<br>
Including use a visualization glue developed by me and friend<br><br>

If anything I did not explain myself clear, feel free to stop me<br>
