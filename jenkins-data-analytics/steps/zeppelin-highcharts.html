<div class="notes">
This is docker image I created for including highcharts in zeppelin<br><br>

zeppelin does not support Highcharts of the shelf<br>
So I developed a library to add Highcharts support<br>
And I call it zeppelin-highcharts<br><br>

Inspired by one question on stackoverflow<br>
spark-shell also does not plot function<br>
So I add support for spark-shell as well<br><br>

And I change name from zeppelin-highcharts to spark-highcharts<br>
Since it can be used either on zeppelin or spark-shell<br><br>

Note: Highcharts is not free for commerical usage<br><br>
