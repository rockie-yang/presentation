<div class="notes">
This is a zeppelin notebook for angluarjs jenkins data<br><br>

I was really upset when I saw there were only 3 testcase failed<br><br>

Then I try to get the statictics of test execution<br>
The maximum devication of duration is half second<br><br>

It is pretty hard to find value for analyze jenkins data for AngularJS<br><br>

They are already very good<br><br>
And perhaps this is the value for this analyze. 
To approve that Angular has pretty good quality<br><br>

https://github.com/jenkinsci/junit-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/hudson/tasks/junit/CaseResult.java<br>

This test has been running OK, but now it failed.
