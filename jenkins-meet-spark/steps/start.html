<div class="notes">

Good afternoon, or evening. Thanks so much for attending the meetup.

I'd like to thanks Ooyala for hosting the meetup.

I'd like to thanks Anton for organizing the meetup. 

I am simple. I mean my brain is simple. 

So I always seeking simple solutions
trying to find simple logical connection in the complex world.

My name is Rockie, Rockie Yang.

The presentation has two parts. 
The first part is about crawling data from Jenkins Server.
It's a bit boring. But it's an essential step for data analysis.

Then we can have a short break.

The second part is about data analysis on Apache Zeppelin 
Including use a visualization glue developed by a friend of mine Honnix and me. 

If anything I did not explain myself clear, feel free to stop me.
