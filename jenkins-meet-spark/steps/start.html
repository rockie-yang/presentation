<div class="notes">

Good afternoon, or evening. Thanks so much for attending this meetup<br>

I'd like to thanks Ooyala for hosting the meetup, thanks Anton for organizing the meetup<br><br>

I am simple... I mean my brain is simple.

So I always seeking simple solutions.
Trying to find simple logical connections in the complex world.

My name is Rockie, Rockie Yang<br>

The presentation has two parts. 
The first part is about crawling data from Jenkins Server.
It's a bit boring. But it's an essential step for data analysis<br><br>

Then we can have a short break<br>

The second part is about data analysis on Apache Zeppelin.
Including use a visualization glue developed by me and friend<br> 

If anything I did not explain myself clear, feel free to stop me<br>
