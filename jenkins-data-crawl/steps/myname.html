My name is Rockie, Rockie Yang<br><br>

The presentation has two parts. <br><br>

The first part is about crawling data from Jenkins Server.<br><br>

It's a bit boring. But it's an essential step for data analysis.
A step to simply the world<br>
<br>

Then we will have a short break<br><br>

The second part is about data analysis with spark on Apache Zeppelin<br>
Use a visualization glue developed by me and friend<br><br>

If anything I did not explain myself clear, feel free to stop me at anytime<br>
